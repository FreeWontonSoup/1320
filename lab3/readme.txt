Firstly, to run this program, you must compile and run it on the omega server. For this program, all specified functionalities in the lab will work.
For the first input to determine the amount of records, float numbers are the ONLY numbers that can be accepted. Anything else (strings) will make the program go crazy. The lab does not say things like this need to be handled so nothing has been done to deal with this. Another issue will be created if the user types a string for the score instead of a float. Again, this did not need to be handled so it wasnâ€™t. Lastly, to search for names, capitalization DOES matter. If looking for a name, it has to be the exact name that was inputted. It will not find the name if it is shortened either. The lab does not say anything about having to work with capitalization. Everything else works as stated from the lab. As long as expected input is typed, the program will work fine.
